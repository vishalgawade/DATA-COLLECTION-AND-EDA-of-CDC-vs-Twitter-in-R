Goal
---
The project fetches the tweets on influenza and plots the heat map to compare how twitter reacted on influenza affected States. The complete project is implemented in R with the help of twitteR and geocode API for collecting tweets.</br>

###### Work on data analysis related to socially relevant current topic. (What better than “flu”?) </br>
###### Learn by analysis of existing data analysis examples or vignettes. (TwitteR vignette) </br>
###### Learn from data analysis and reporting examples available in public sources. (Flu.gov) </br>
###### Apply methods for collecting data from publicly available data sources: flu.gov, fluview.</br>
###### Install a work environment for carrying out various activities of the data science process: Jupyter, R, RStudio. </br>
###### Extract data using APIs and OAuth keys (for collecting tweets). </br>
###### Process the data collected for simple data analysis and charting (reproducible research).</br>
